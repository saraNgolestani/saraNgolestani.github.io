# For syntax highlighting, the primary programming langauge you intend to use in
# blog articles. By default, Google's prettify will be used for this programming
# language, as per the instructions here: https://github.com/google/code-prettify
# For example, if I indicate `scala`, all pre/code blocks will have the `lang-scala`
# class added to the markup, triggering prettify to highlight the syntax as Scala.
primarylanguage: java
# To sidestep the default language for syntax highlighting set here, you can be
# explicit in your blog articles with the langauge you'd prefer to use. E.g.,
# <pre>
#   <code class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
#    ..ruby code here...
#   </code>
# </pre>
