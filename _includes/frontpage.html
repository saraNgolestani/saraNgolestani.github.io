            I'm interested in various flavors of distributed and concurrent
            computation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Software Engineering</li>
            <li>Data Engineering,</li>
            <li>Machine Learning,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My principal research interests are in the area of <b class="red_text"> <b class="red_text"><i>Software Engineering</i></b>,  <b class="red_text"><i>Data Engineering</i></b>, and <i>Machine Learning</i></b>. 
            While a wide range of operations could be done in each one of these fields, as a bachelor student, 
            I did not have enough time to get highly deep into each of them. So, I tried some disciplines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being a Software Engineering trainee in one of the top universities of Iran encouraged me to practice 
            in different sections of Software Engineering. I have done some studies in Cloud Computing inclouding 
            Workflow Scheduling and Resource Allocation with Meta-Heuristic methods at the Cloud Computing Lab 
            under the Supv of Dr. Abrishami. Besides, as a professional technical lead and software engineer 
            in Fanap Co., I am working on a cloud platform and cloud storage which made me investigate distributed systems. 
            Additionally, I have been a teacher assistant in the software engineering lab for more than a year researching 
            open-source software and games' architecture and design under the Supv of Dr. Rasoolzadegan.

          </p>

          <p>
            Data Engineering is the second field on my list. Working with Dr. Behshid Behkamal on geospatial data, 
            National Post's data and passing the Data Mining course interested me in this field. 
            I worked on geo-location data for almost two years as a member of WTLab with Dr. Pourmasoumi and Dr. Behkamal. 
            During this time, I worked as a part of the team working on an industrial project 
            for the National Post company. This project proposed to predict the parcel delivery time based on 
            the current system and find the bottlenecks in the current system with process mining and Machine Learning techniques.
